# KeepTeamsLightGreen
A scripting program that uses Windows sendkeys function to write to a notepad window, keeping the Microsoft teams status light green or "Available"

Instructions: Download the .vbs file, open an untitled notepad window (the title of the window must be "Untitled - Notepad"), double click the vbs file to run and your teams light will stay green. The program will stop running by itself after 2 hours 22.5 minutes or if you close the untitled notepad window the program will simply stop before it tries to call the sendkeys function again.
